# Neural-Rendering-and-Dynamic-Segmentation-for-Novel-View-Generation-in-3D-Scenes
This project presents a complete neural rendering and novel view synthesis system developed from scratch. It focuses on learning 3D scenes from multi-view images using optimizable volumetric radiance field models, such as Gaussian Splatting, to generate new perspectives from arbitrary camera viewpoints.
